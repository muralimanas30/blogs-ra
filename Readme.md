## Overview

This project is built using React and incorporates a variety of powerful libraries to enhance functionality, improve user experience, and streamline development. Below is a detailed explanation of the libraries used in this project.

## Libraries Used

### 1. [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
Easily add icons to your application with a wide range of icon sets. This library provides a simple way to include icons without the need for external image files.

### 2. [react-toastify](https://github.com/fkhadra/react-toastify)
Add customizable toast notifications to your app. This library allows you to display notifications in a user-friendly manner, enhancing the overall user experience.

### 3. [react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/)
Manage server state in your React applications with ease. React Query simplifies data fetching, caching, and synchronization, making it a powerful tool for handling asynchronous data.

### 4. [axios](https://axios-http.com/)
A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. Axios is an alternative to the native `fetch` API, providing a more robust and feature-rich way to make HTTP requests.

### 5. [formik](https://formik.org/)
A popular library for handling forms in React. Formik simplifies form management, validation, and submission, allowing you to focus on building your application.

### 6. [yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup)
A schema builder for value parsing and validation. Yup is commonly used with Formik to validate form inputs, ensuring data integrity and user feedback.

### 7. [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/)
The standard routing library for React. React Router enables dynamic routing in your application, allowing for seamless navigation between different views.

### 8. [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
A powerful library for animations in React. Framer Motion provides a simple API for creating complex animations and transitions, enhancing the visual appeal of your application.

### 9. [classnames](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames)
A utility for conditionally joining class names together. Classnames makes it easy to manage CSS classes based on component state or props.

### 10. [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx)
An alternative to classnames, clsx is a tiny utility for constructing className strings conditionally. It offers a simple and efficient way to manage class names.

### 11. [lodash](https://lodash.com/)
A modern JavaScript utility library delivering modularity, performance, and extras. Lodash provides a wide range of functions for common programming tasks, making development faster and easier.

### 12. [moment](https://momentjs.com/)
A library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates. Moment.js simplifies date handling, although it is relatively large in size.

### 13. [dayjs](https://day.js.org/)
A lightweight alternative to Moment.js for date manipulation. Day.js offers a similar API with a much smaller footprint, making it ideal for performance-sensitive applications.
